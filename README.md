# TestChain

TestChain is a Docker-based test framework for blockchain research. It is developed by the [Blockchain and Reputation Research Group, Northeastern University (China)](http://www.blockchain-neu.com), which is supervised by [Associate Professor Yuan Liu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/swc/liuyuan/).

## Framework

TestChain is based on the basic model proposed by Yuan Y. and Wang F.-Y. in their work "Blockchain: The State of the Art and Future Trends", which includes 6 layers in this model. In TestChain, the basic template of bottom 4 layers (the data layer, network layer, consensus layer and incentive layer) is provided, and some basic consensus machanisms are (or will be) re-implemented.

### Data Layer

* Transaction
* Block
* Chain

### Network Layer

* P2P

### Consensus Layer

* Message
* Protocol

### Incentive Layer

* Coin
* Wallet

## Usage
